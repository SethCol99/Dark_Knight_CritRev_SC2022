# Dark_Knight_CritRev_SC2022
Critical review I wrote of The Dark Knight for one of my film classes Spring Semester of my Sophomore year in college. 
Topics of the film are sectioned off, and sources are cited. This is one of few papers I've ever written that I thoroughly didn't mind, and I decided I can mix it with my CS skills and turn it into an HTML web page. It's also a little sad, but if I'm being totally honest, this is one of few CS projects I've done in college that I think are genuinely marketable to tech employers, ESPECIALLY that I've worked on alone. I still have the water cycle page and the typing test project that are still in the works but this is the only one for now. Anyway, I may implement a form element for input to the review afetr it's created as a web page (since I did have to trim it down when I wrote it so it wouldn't go too far over the word count) but that will come later if it does. So yea
