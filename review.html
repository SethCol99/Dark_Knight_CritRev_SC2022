        <h3>The Production Being Discussed</h3>
        <div>
        <p>The film being written about in this analysis is The Dark Knight (2008), a cinematic <br>
            and technical marvel revolving around the forces of good and evil in the form of a <br>
            superhero and villain. The film was directed by Christopher Nolan, a mastermind in the <br>
            Film industry, who has multiple other extremely successful films to his name, including <br>
            Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017).<br><br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <p>The story is about the very iconic superhero and supervillain dynamic of Batman, played by <br>
            Christain Bale, and The Joker, played by Heath Ledger. Batman faces the very intelligent, <br>
            dark-minded and unpredictable Joker. This time, Batman is joined in the by the newly elected <br>
            District Attorney, Harvey Dent, who was elected “on a promise of bringing an end to the city's <br>
            crime wave” (Fandom). However, after a series of heinous crimes, including murder, arson, theft, <br>
            and destruction of the city, The Joker leaves Batman and Dent questioning how they will stop <br>
            him, and if it's even possible, This battle becomes even harder for good to win after The Joker <br>
            murders Dent's love interest and leaves him burned and scarred, which causes Dent to also become <br>
            evil, which he originally set out to destroy.

    <h3>Common Themes</h3>

    <p>The most obvious theme I noticed in this film is the battle of good and evil. Batman's entire identity <br>
        stems from his desire to avenge the murder of his parents by fighting crime in his city and preying on <br>
        those who prey on the innocent, which, in this case, is The Joker. Batman represents good, or at least a <br>
        variant of good. On the other hand, The Joker wants nothing more than to kill, steal, and destroy <br>
        everything that Batman stands for. Both sides can be seen in the character of Harvey Dent, as he <br>
        essentially ends up fighting both sides due to his heroic origins and villainous character arc.</p>

    <p>Another big theme in this film is the corruptibility of man, with the best example being the character <br>
        arch of Harvey Dent. He is introduced and built up as a purely intentioned hero with a clean reputation <br>
        who uses the justice system instead of violence to fight crime. David Chen says "Dent represents absolute <br>
        good, a goodness that is so pure, that has so much potential to change Gotham, that even Batman considers <br>
        hanging up his spurs" (SlashFilm). However, with the murder of his fiance, Rachel, and brutal burning <br>
        that The Joker inflicts on him, Harvey is turned to evil as he seeks revenge for Rachel, which involves him <br>
        committing murders of his own, and basically undoes everything he's done to fight crime in Gotham. Another <br>
        smaller example could be when the civilians and prisoners are put on the ferries, and the Joker threatens to <br>
        blow both boats up, if one doesn't pull the trigger on the other first. Once this threat is made, the civilians, <br>
        who are normally moral, begin supporting blowing up the prisoners. Although an argument can be made to justify <br>
        either decision, it goes to show that people will change or abandon their morals based on their
        circumstances.<br><br>

    <h3>Mise-en-Scene</h3>
Something I found particularly interesting about the mise-en-scene was the rugged and dirty look of the Jokers
makeup.<br>
The makeup and hair isn't neat, but patchy, lacking the clean, sharp look previous Jokers had. His clothes, although<br>
still colorful and formal, are still dull in color, unsaturated, and not exactly neat. This look serves the purpose
of<br>
making him darker and more intimidating, along with making him more natural. Seung Ho talks about this as well, and<br>
compares him to Jack Nicolson's Joker saying “The makeup and hair is done so that it looks natural. Jack's Joker<br>
seem[ed] artificial with perfect makeup and hair” (Weebly). This appearance is very effective for The Joker's
character<br>
since the natural aspect of his makeup and costume bring him closer to us as humans, which combines with his actions
and<br>
dark persona to give viewers the feeling that this character could actually exist. As mentioned, most, if not all
Jokers<br>
were lacking this effect.<br><br>

Another aspect of costuming I thought worked well was making more of Batman's suit black, as opposed to the large
amount<br>
of yellow he would traditionally have. This was effective to the film because, similar to The Joker's look that was
just<br>
mentioned, it made the appearance fresh, and didn't have the same exact look that Batman traditionally had. On top
of<br>
the much darker color pallet, his suite looked much more technologically advanced, which conveyed a more tactical
and<br>
futuristic version of the character. Maybe some wouldn't be attracted to this look, but I thought it did a great job
of<br>
making him seem more powerful and capable of everything he did with the suit that was maybe less realistic, while
still<br>
maintaining verisimilitude. Because of that aspect, it was a lot easier to take him seriously.<br>

<h3>Small Criticism of Props and Costume</h3>
Overall, the costuming was very well done, in my opinion, since the film experimented with unconventional elements
to<br>
make for a fresh and more powerful feel. However, one improvement to mise-en-scene I think the filmmakers could've
made<br>
is making Batman just a bit more verisimilar. As previously mentioned, they bridged the gap between the realism in<br>
Batman's suit and the realism in his abilities, however I think they could do a bit more to explain the science and<br>
mechanics behind his suit and utilities. For example, in the first half of the film, Lucious shows Bruce a new piece
he<br>
developed for the suit that is weaponized, improves Bruce's mobility, allowing for more agile movement, and provides<br>
better protection against certain threats. Lucious does give a very brief explanation for the design and benefits of
the<br>
new piece, but it still doesn't make a lot of sense as to how it could be developed the way he explains it. it's<br>
understandable, since the focus of the piece is more about the fact that it works and benefits Batman, as opposed to
how<br>
it works. One might even argue that “it's just a movie, it's not supposed to be realistic”, and that's true.
However,<br>
it's still frustrating to be in the dark about how these elements of the film work, and arguably, almost makes the<br>
viewer feel a bit separated from the characters. This is especially true for a character like Batman who is known as
the<br>
superhero without any special, unrealistic powers, and just uses wealth and intelligence.<br><br>

<h3>Effects</h3>
<p>
A very impressive element of this film is the use of practical effects when CGI would be not just beneficial, but<br>
justified. Zachary Kandell from Screen Rant states, “Director Christopher Nolan uses practical effects where
possible<br>
rather than CGI in his movies, and this runs across The Dark Knight Trilogy” (ScreenRant). When successful, this<br>
approach conveys dedication to giving the audience authenticity, which I find admirable. Two big examples of
practical<br>
effects were the truck flip and the hospital explosion.<br><br>

The truck flip was done with an explosive piston that, when triggered by the stunt driver, sent the truck up enough
to<br>
flip completely about the cabin, landing upside down. There were many infrastructural issues to worry about, such as<br>
“If [the truck] gets halfway up and falls to the side… it wouldve gone through a [buildings] window” (ScreenRant).<br>
They also had to worry about the infrastructure of the street itself, including that “...there were only a couple
places<br>
on the street they could fire the piston without causing serious damage to something underground, making it so the<br>
driver could only trigger [the piston] at one of a couple of specific locations.” (ScreenRant). There were other
safety<br>
issues, according to Kandell, however, the stunt turned out not only successful, but very memorable.<br><br>

The hospital explosion was also done very practically. As Cooper Hood, from ScreenRant states, according to
Christopher<br>
Nolan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould had an idea: Heath would walk through the hospital with smaller<br>
explosions going off, then after they stopped, there would be a beat where nothing happened, and Heath would act
like<br>
the explosions were malfunctioning. In reality, this beat was intentional and made sure Heath could escape the
hospital<br>
before the larger explosions occurred, bringing the building down completely. Of course, this meant “that [Nolan]
had<br>
one shot at getting it right”, and so, a lot of planning took place, as Hood also says, “Not only was the scene
executed<br>
exactly as Nolan and his team wanted, but it also came after extensive practice” (ScreenRant). In the end, they
executed<br>
the scene authentically, which made it a very impressive example of successful practical effects.<br><br>

<h3>Cinematography</h3>
In general, the cinematography was very well done. Nolan uses a combination of many, long, dramatic, and slowly
paced<br>
establishing shots that lead into quick, dynamic closer shots right after. This gives the audience time to develop a<br>
sense of space and situation, right before diving right into the heat of the action within that scene which then
keeps<br>
the audience entertained. This is possibly the most noticeable in the first scene where The Joker and his men rob
the<br>
bank. There is a great variety in shot types, dynamic and static shots, and shades of lighting, among other
elements,<br>
used throughout the film to make for a very dramatic but entertaining experience.<br><br>

<h3>Criticism of Cinematography and Editing</h3>
Although the cinematography is stellar overall, there are moments I've noticed where certain shots are filmed and
edited<br>
so that it's tough to understand what's going on, and even almost seemingly lacking continuity. An example that comes
to<br>
mind is the scene where Batman infiltrates Lau's office to capture him and question him for involvement in the mob's<br>
crimes. The scene begins with a textbook establishing shot, encompassing the tower Batman is standing on as he
watches<br>
over Lau's office. However, a series of close ups show Batman placing explosives on the office windows and breaching
the<br>
building as they go off. Although viewers can piece together that this is what's happening, it's very confusing to<br>
figure out from just watching the shots because the way they are captured and edited, they don't capture the scene
very<br>
well.<br><br>

<nav class="content" id="Acting">
    <h3>Acting</h3>
<p>
Arguably the most impressive aspect of this entire film is the performance that Heath Ledger gives in playing The
Joker.<br>
I firmly believe that one can't write a well rounded critical analysis of this film without mentioning Ledger's<br>
absolutely embodied performance as his psychopathic character. It may just be the greatest case of method acting in<br>
modern cinematic history. Jake Massey from Lad Bible says “[Ledger] locked himself away for weeks, keeping a diary”,
the<br>
location he was locked in being a hotel. He later states “The diary contained a wide array of manic musing,
depicting<br>
hyenas, clowns, comic strips…”(LadBible). He was also method acting on the physical end as well, “...encouraging
co-star<br>
Christain Bale [Batman] to actually hit him during an interrogation scene”. Bale mentions “'He was slamming himself<br>
around, and there were tiled walls inside of that set which were cracked and dented from him hurling himself into
them'”<br>
(LadBible). Heath's commitment to the role was covered in every aspect of his performance. He dove into his
character<br>
physically, mentally, psychologically and emotionally using the method technique to the fullest extent, which was
one<br>
of, if not the most impressive elements of the film.<br><br>
