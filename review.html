        <h3>The Production Being Discussed</h3>
        <div>
        <p>The film being written about in this analysis is The Dark Knight (2008), a cinematic <br>
            and technical marvel revolving around the forces of good and evil in the form of a <br>
            superhero and villain. The film was directed by Christopher Nolan, a mastermind in the <br>
            Film industry, who has multiple other extremely successful films to his name, including <br>
            Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk (2017).<br><br>
        </p>
        </div>

        <div>
        <p>The story is about the very iconic superhero and supervillain dynamic of Batman, played by <br>
            Christain Bale, and The Joker, played by Heath Ledger. Batman faces the very intelligent, <br>
            dark-minded and unpredictable Joker. This time, Batman is joined in the by the newly elected <br>
            District Attorney, Harvey Dent, who was elected “on a promise of bringing an end to the city's <br>
            crime wave” (Fandom). However, after a series of heinous crimes, including murder, arson, theft, <br>
            and destruction of the city, The Joker leaves Batman and Dent questioning how they will stop <br>
            him, and if it's even possible, This battle becomes even harder for good to win after The Joker <br>
            murders Dent's love interest and leaves him burned and scarred, which causes Dent to also become <br>
            evil, which he originally set out to destroy.

    <h3>Common Themes</h3>

    <p>The most obvious theme I noticed in this film is the battle of good and evil. Batman's entire identity <br>
        stems from his desire to avenge the murder of his parents by fighting crime in his city and preying on <br>
        those who prey on the innocent, which, in this case, is The Joker. Batman represents good, or at least a <br>
        variant of good. On the other hand, The Joker wants nothing more than to kill, steal, and destroy <br>
        variant of good. On the other hand, The Joker wants nothing more than to kill, steal, and destroy <br>
        everything that Batman stands for. Both sides can be seen in the character of Harvey Dent, as he <br>
        essentially ends up fighting both sides due to his heroic origins and villainous character arc.</p>

    <p>Another big theme in this film is the corruptibility of man, with the best example being the character <br>
        arch of Harvey Dent. He is introduced and built up as a purely intentioned hero with a clean reputation <br>
        who uses the justice system instead of violence to fight crime. David Chen says "Dent represents absolute <br>
        good, a goodness that is so pure, that has so much potential to change Gotham, that even Batman considers <br>
        hanging up his spurs" (SlashFilm). However, with the murder of his fiance, Rachel, and brutal burning <br>
        that The Joker inflicts on him, Harvey is turned to evil as he seeks revenge for Rachel, which involves him <br>
        committing murders of his own, and basically undoes everything he's done to fight crime in Gotham. Another <br>
        smaller example could be when the civilians and prisoners are put on the ferries, and the Joker threatens to <br>
        blow both boats up, if one doesn't pull the trigger on the other first. Once this threat is made, the civilians, <br>
        who are normally moral, begin supporting blowing up the prisoners. Although an argument can be made to justify <br>
        either decision, it goes to show that people will change or abandon their morals based on their
        circumstances.<br><br>

    <h3>Mise-en-Scene</h3>
Something I found particularly interesting about the mise-en-scene was the rugged and dirty look of the Jokers makeup.
The makeup and hair isn't neat, but patchy, lacking the clean, sharp look previous Jokers had. His clothes, although
still colorful and formal, are still dull in color, unsaturated, and not exactly neat. This look serves the purpose of
making him darker and more intimidating, along with making him more natural. Seung Ho talks about this as well, and
compares him to Jack Nicolson's Joker saying “The makeup and hair is done so that it looks natural. Jack's Joker
seem[ed] artificial with perfect makeup and hair” (Weebly). This appearance is very effective for The Joker's character
since the natural aspect of his makeup and costume bring him closer to us as humans, which combines with his actions and
dark persona to give viewers the feeling that this character could actually exist. As mentioned, most, if not all Jokers
were lacking this effect.

Another aspect of costuming I thought worked well was making more of Batman's suit black, as opposed to the large amount
of yellow he would traditionally have. This was effective to the film because, similar to The Joker's look that was just
mentioned, it made the appearance fresh, and didn't have the same exact look that Batman traditionally had. On top of
the much darker color pallet, his suite looked much more technologically advanced, which conveyed a more tactical and
futuristic version of the character. Maybe some wouldn't be attracted to this look, but I thought it did a great job of
making him seem more powerful and capable of everything he did with the suit that was maybe less realistic, while still
maintaining verisimilitude. Because of that aspect, it was a lot easier to take him seriously.

Small Criticism of Props and Costume
Overall, the costuming was very well done, in my opinion, since the film experimented with unconventional elements to
make for a fresh and more powerful feel. However, one improvement to mise-en-scene I think the filmmakers could've made
is making Batman just a bit more verisimilar. As previously mentioned, they bridged the gap between the realism in
Batman's suit and the realism in his abilities, however I think they could do a bit more to explain the science and
mechanics behind his suit and utilities. For example, in the first half of the film, Lucious shows Bruce a new piece he
developed for the suit that is weaponized, improves Bruce's mobility, allowing for more agile movement, and provides
better protection against certain threats. Lucious does give a very brief explanation for the design and benefits of the
new piece, but it still doesn't make a lot of sense as to how it could be developed the way he explains it. it's
understandable, since the focus of the piece is more about the fact that it works and benefits Batman, as opposed to how
it works. One might even argue that “it's just a movie, it's not supposed to be realistic”, and that's true. However,
it's still frustrating to be in the dark about how these elements of the film work, and arguably, almost makes the
viewer feel a bit separated from the characters. This is especially true for a character like Batman who is known as the
superhero without any special, unrealistic powers, and just uses wealth and intelligence.

Effects
A very impressive element of this film is the use of practical effects when CGI would be not just beneficial, but
justified. Zachary Kandell from Screen Rant states, “Director Christopher Nolan uses practical effects where possible
rather than CGI in his movies, and this runs across The Dark Knight Trilogy” (ScreenRant). When successful, this
approach conveys dedication to giving the audience authenticity, which I find admirable. Two big examples of practical
effects were the truck flip and the hospital explosion.

The truck flip was done with an explosive piston that, when triggered by the stunt driver, sent the truck up enough to
flip completely about the cabin, landing upside down. There were many infrastructural issues to worry about, such as
“If [the truck] gets halfway up and falls to the side… it wouldve gone through a [buildings] window” (ScreenRant).
They also had to worry about the infrastructure of the street itself, including that “...there were only a couple places
on the street they could fire the piston without causing serious damage to something underground, making it so the
driver could only trigger [the piston] at one of a couple of specific locations.” (ScreenRant). There were other safety
issues, according to Kandell, however, the stunt turned out not only successful, but very memorable.

The hospital explosion was also done very practically. As Cooper Hood, from ScreenRant states, according to Christopher
Nolan, special effects supervisor Chris Corbould had an idea: Heath would walk through the hospital with smaller
explosions going off, then after they stopped, there would be a beat where nothing happened, and Heath would act like
the explosions were malfunctioning. In reality, this beat was intentional and made sure Heath could escape the hospital
before the larger explosions occurred, bringing the building down completely. Of course, this meant “that [Nolan] had
one shot at getting it right”, and so, a lot of planning took place, as Hood also says, “Not only was the scene executed
exactly as Nolan and his team wanted, but it also came after extensive practice” (ScreenRant). In the end, they executed
the scene authentically, which made it a very impressive example of successful practical effects.

Cinematography
In general, the cinematography was very well done. Nolan uses a combination of many, long, dramatic, and slowly paced
establishing shots that lead into quick, dynamic closer shots right after. This gives the audience time to develop a
sense of space and situation, right before diving right into the heat of the action within that scene which then keeps
the audience entertained. This is possibly the most noticeable in the first scene where The Joker and his men rob the
bank. There is a great variety in shot types, dynamic and static shots, and shades of lighting, among other elements,
used throughout the film to make for a very dramatic but entertaining experience.

Criticism of Cinematography and Editing
Although the cinematography is stellar overall, there are moments I've noticed where certain shots are filmed and edited
so that it's tough to understand what's going on, and even almost seemingly lacking continuity. An example that comes to
mind is the scene where Batman infiltrates Lau's office to capture him and question him for involvement in the mob's
crimes. The scene begins with a textbook establishing shot, encompassing the tower Batman is standing on as he watches
over Lau's office. However, a series of close ups show Batman placing explosives on the office windows and breaching the
building as they go off. Although viewers can piece together that this is what's happening, it's very confusing to
figure out from just watching the shots because the way they are captured and edited, they don't capture the scene very
well.

Acting
Arguably the most impressive aspect of this entire film is the performance that Heath Ledger gives in playing The Joker.
I firmly believe that one can't write a well rounded critical analysis of this film without mentioning Ledger's
absolutely embodied performance as his psychopathic character. It may just be the greatest case of method acting in
modern cinematic history. Jake Massey from Lad Bible says “[Ledger] locked himself away for weeks, keeping a diary”, the
location he was locked in being a hotel. He later states “The diary contained a wide array of manic musing, depicting
hyenas, clowns, comic strips…”(LadBible). He was also method acting on the physical end as well, “...encouraging co-star
Christain Bale [Batman] to actually hit him during an interrogation scene”. Bale mentions “'He was slamming himself
around, and there were tiled walls inside of that set which were cracked and dented from him hurling himself into them'”
(LadBible). Heath's commitment to the role was covered in every aspect of his performance. He dove into his character
physically, mentally, psychologically and emotionally using the method technique to the fullest extent, which was one
of, if not the most impressive elements of the film
